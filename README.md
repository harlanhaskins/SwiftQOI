# SwiftQOI

SwiftQOI is an in-progress implementation of the [Quite OK Image Format](https://qoiformat.org).

It supports encoding QOI images, but does not yet support decoding.

## Installation

SwiftQOI can be added to your project using Swift Package Manager. For more
information on using SwiftPM in Xcode, see [Apple's guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app)

If you're using package dependencies directly, you can add this as one of your dependencies:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/harlanhaskins/SwiftQOI.git", from: "0.0.1")
]
```
